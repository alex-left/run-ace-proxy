- set the default local aceproxy server reading it from an config/enviroment file (for example: /etc/ace.conf) to avoid set it 
by parameter if you use a player in different machine than docker engine. 
- get urls from more providers Â¿suggestions? I only know arenavision
- add more players? I only use VLC. 
- investigate a way to send the stream to kodi directly avoiding the strm file generation (maybe by kodi's api?)
- create an installer?
- organize, improve and Beautify the code.
